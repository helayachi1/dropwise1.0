#ðŸŒ± Dropwise â€“ Smart Irrigation System
Dropwise is my graduation project at the National Vocational Training Institute (INFSP). It is a smart irrigation system developed to optimize water usage and enhance crop productivity by integrating ESP32 microcontrollers with a TSX37 PLC.

The system includes a user-friendly web application hosted directly on the ESP32, providing remote access and control of irrigation processes. Dropwise combines automation, real-time monitoring, and efficient water management to deliver a practical solution for modern agriculture.
