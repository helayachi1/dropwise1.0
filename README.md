# ðŸŒ± Dropwise â€“ Smart Irrigation System

**Dropwise** is my **graduation project at the National Vocational Training Institute**.  
It is a smart irrigation system developed to optimize water usage and enhance crop productivity by integrating **ESP32 microcontrollers** with a **TSX37 PLC**.

The system includes a **user-friendly web application** hosted directly on the ESP32, providing **remote access and control** of irrigation processes.  
Dropwise combines automation, real-time monitoring, and efficient water management to deliver a practical solution for modern agriculture.

## ðŸ”§ Key Technologies
- ESP32 Microcontroller (Web server, sensor integration)
- TSX37 PLC (Process control)
- HTML5 / CSS3 / JavaScript (Web interface)
- Real-time data display (e.g., water level, temperature)

## ðŸŽ¯ Project Goals
- Improve irrigation efficiency
- Provide remote monitoring and control
- Reduce water waste through automation
- Create a low-cost, scalable solution for farmers
